Take home evaluation

This repository contains the notebook for a three part data analysis take home assignment for the Springboard data science career track.  In part 1, time series data is evaluated to identify trends. In part two we are asked to define a key metric involved in setting up an experiment, and detail the steps of implementation.  Part 3 asks us to build a predictive model to predict retention in a made up car service.
